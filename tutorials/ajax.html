<h1>Ajax &amp; Templates</h1>
<p>Each libary provides the ability to perform Ajax requests and posts. Visit the sites for <a href='http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/?rdfrom=http%3A%2F%2Fdocs.jquery.com%2Fmw%2Findex.php%3Ftitle%3DAjax%26redirect%3Dno' target='new'>jQuery</a> and <a href='http://zeptojs.com/#ajax' target='new'>Zepto</a> to learn how they handle Ajax. The documentation below is specifically for ChocolateChip.js</p>

<p>You can find a simple example of Ajax requests for JSON data in the templates folder inside the examples folder. That example makes a request for JSON data that gets rendered out using Handlebars templates.</p>

<h2>Element.xhr</h2>

<p>It's one thing to have a bunch of nice layouts and widgets to play with, but without data, they are pretty useless. That's were Ajax and templates come in handy.</p>

<p>To start with, ChocolateChip-UI provides Ajax capabilities with Element.xhr. You call this on the element where you want the data to be injected.</p>

<p>In the following example we execute the xhr method directly on the contain in which we want the content to be inserted. If there is an error retrieving the file (change the name in the example) it will output the designated error message to the app.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<pre><code>var content = $("#content1");
content.xhr("data.html", {
    errorCallback: function() {
        content.insert("&lt;h2&gt;There was an error getting the file.&lt;/h2&gt;");
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>In this example we use the callback to slightly change how the injection is occurring. Actually, when you use a callback you could decide based on some conditional logic even where the content get's injected.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<pre><code>var content = $("#content1");
content.xhr("data.html", {
    successCallback: function() {
        // Indicate where to insert the response.
        content.insert($.responseText);
        $.responseText = null;
    },
    errorCallback: function() {
        content.insert("&lt;h2&gt;There was an error getting the file.&lt;/h2&gt;");
    }
}); 
</code></pre>

<p>If you are going to use some type of conditional logic to determine where to inject your Ajax response, you might want to instead execute the XHR request directly on the app itself:</p>

<pre><code>$.app.xhr("data.html", {
    successCallback: function() {
        // Indicate where to insert the response.
        if (/*condition is met*/) {
             content.insert($.responseText);
             $.responseText = null;
         } else {
             $("#anotherContainer").insert($.responseText);
         }
    },
    errorCallback: function() {
        content.insert("&lt;h2&gt;There was an error getting the file.&lt;/h2&gt;");
    }
}); 
</code></pre>

<p>The file that you call could be a complete HTML document. Element.xhr will stip out all but the contents of the body tag, which you would then be inserting in the target element. You do not need to make the documents be whole HTML pages. They can just be document fragments with a file type of HTML. The Ajax call will still read them in as expected.</p>

<p>When making mobile Web apps for installation on a user's device, you do not need to worry about cross domain issues. When the installed app makes an Ajax call back to the original domain, its request will not be rejected. Of course, it could not make a request to other domains, same problem as any other Ajax implementation.</p>

<h2>Element.xhrjson</h2>

<p>This method allows you to bind JSON data to elements in your app. It's very straightforward. Just create a JSON object with values that you can map to items in your document.</p>

<p>You would normally use Ajax in conjunction with a template engine to output your data to your app. Please visit the tutorial about templating to learn more about your options.</p>

<p>ChocolateChip.js itself provides a simple means of generating templates. However, if you have needs for robust and efficient templating for large amounts of data, by all means use a dedicated templating framework.
