<h1>Data Binding</h1>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a href='http://knockoutjs.com/'>Knockout.js</a></h2>

<p>Knockoutjs is a powerful, client-side data-binding engine. It allows you to create view models and then bind your markup to them using declarative expressions. When the view model changes, the markup updates automatically, no DOM manipulation required on your part. Knockoutjs can be used with static markup to create dynamic temlates, or it can be used with an actual template engine.</p>

<p>ChocolateChip-UI includes an example of using Knockoutjs in the 'data-binding' folder in the examples.</p>


<h2><a href='https://github.com/BorisMoore/jsviews'>JSViews</a></h2>

<p>If you're already using JSRender as your template needs, you can combine that with JSViews to achieve client-side data binding on your templates similar to what Knockoutjs does.</p>
