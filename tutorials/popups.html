<p>ChocolateChip-UI includes popups as a way for you to provide your app with modal dialog windows. ChocolateChip-UI's popup comes with certain functionality out of the box. Clicking the Cancel or Done uibuttons will automatically close it.</p>

<ul>
<li>selector: A selector for the container into which the popup will be inserted. This allows you to have popups in different areas of your app. If no selector is supplied it defaults to the app tag.</li>
<li>title: A title for the popup to display. The default is "Alert!".</li>
<li>message: A message to display under the title. This should be some type of instruction or informative message so the user knows why the popup has appeared and what to do next.</li>
<li>cancelUIButton: An alternate name for the Cancel uibutton. It's default is Cancel.</li>
<li>continueUIButton: And alternate name for the Continue uibutton. It's default is Continue.</li>
<li>callback: A function to execute when the user touches the Continue uibutton.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you create a popup but do not pass any values for title, message or the Cancel and Continue uibuttons, ChocolateChip-UI will create the popup with defaults. The title will be "Attention!", the message will be empty, the Cancel uibutton will be named Cancel, the Continue uibutton will be named Continue, and no callback means nothing will happen when the dialog is dispelled.</p>

<p>Below is an example of the parameters to create a popu, along with other values. As in other controls, you can pass a placeholder argument to the callback which, when the callback gets executed will have the value of "this", which will be the popup itself. This let you do whatever you might want to do with the popup when the user selects the Continue uibutton.</p>

<p>In the example popup initialization below, note how a callback is being passed in. This will get executed when the user selects the Continue uibutton, which in this instance is getting renamed as "Stay for it".</p>

<pre><code>$.UIPopUp(
    {
        selector: "#main", /* insert popup in main view */
        title: 'Attention Viewers!', 
        message: 'This is a message from the sponsors. Please be seated while we are getting ready. Thank you for your patience.', 
        cancelUIButton: 'Skip', 
        continueUIButton: 'Stay for it', 
        callback: function() {
            var popupMessageTarget = document.querySelector('#popupMessageTarget');
            popupMessageTarget.textContent = 'Thanks for staying with us a bit longer.';
            popupMessageTarget.className = "";
            popupMessageTarget.className = "animatePopupMessage";
        }
    }
); 
</code></pre>

<p>To show the popup we attach an event to a uibutton with the $.UIShowPopUp method. The parameter we pass it is the contain in which the popup was created. In this case it's "#main" because in the code above we inserted the popup in the main view. $.UIShowPopUp uses this to find the popup regardless of what its id is.</p>

<pre><code>// Bind event to show the popup:
$("#openPopup").on("click", function() {
    $.UIShowPopUp("#main");
});
</code></pre>
